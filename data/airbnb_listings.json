It's a village within a city with lovely views, cafes & restaurants, parks, a library, a great bakery and grocery stores.   If you enjoy running or hiking, it's a perfect place to visit because you get the best of both worlds.  Also right down the hill is the Mission District which is chock-filled with restaurants, clubs and shops.  The top of Bernal Heights offers a spectacular 360 degree view of the city and the bay.  For those who have a car, there is plenty  free street parking on Ripley or adjacent streets in Bernal Heights during the day.  In the evenings, when neighbors return from work you may have to park in adjacent streets in the neighborhood.  Staying in  Bernal Heights during your visit to San Francisco will make you feel like you are an \"insider\" rather than a visitor living in a hotel downtown.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/af7ceb5b-c603-417a-986e-b4060104cc43.jpg", "host_id": 18732, "host_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/18732", "host_name": "Cecilia", "host_since": "2009-05-25T00:00:00.000Z", "host_location": "San Francisco, CA", "host_about": "I\u2019ve lived in San Francisco for 30+years & I love my condo, neighborhood & my city!\r\nI am passionate about Music and the Arts. \r\nI am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen, strong scents just to name a few.
